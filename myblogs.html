    <p class="section ow">unequivocally, it’s quite interesting to apprise everyone and at the same time seek the answer putting their mind into the state of churn and find out who’s know the hostel better. it’s quite interesting to let on everyone that I have added few fact based questions regarding individuals ,hostel and many more. it’s like playing quiz game things once you go through it and play the quiz game then based on your answers it would determine your score and position number.. so, rather than extravagantly wasting the precious time in Tête-à-Tête. time test your knowledge along with luck and pluck ,further more ,i would like to challenge or dare all the hostelite to come check out your preconceived knowledge whether its hold truism or not. </p>

    <p class="section ow">Do we really know the computer? This question might be appearing to many people that why such an odd question is being put forward which can be answered by a nursery kid. Such as computer is a machine which perform arithmetic and logical operation based on the input given to it.. but but , computer is much more beyond it , beyond and behind the theoretical definition the more you dig deeper the much more you find as we know devil is always found in details. So , my intention here is quite crystal clear to make you or everyone aware about the unknown facts about computer which hardly bother to novice learner or even freshers to be taken account. So without holding grudges against knowledge its high time to challenge oneself and gain the comparably comprehensive factual things about computer which will help to clear the persistently tearing apprehension.. so its time give a try.. so here you go everyone..</p>
